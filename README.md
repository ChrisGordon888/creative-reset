# Focus Reset

Focus Reset is a lightweight web application designed to help users reduce overwhelm and regain clarity through a short, structured reset.

This project demonstrates front-end development, form handling, third-party API integration, and thoughtful UX design for real-world use cases.

---

## Overview

Focus Reset guides users through a structured intake that surfaces:
- current goals
- constraints
- available time
- energy drains
- preferred working rhythm

Submissions trigger a two-part email flow:
1. A full internal summary for the administrator
2. A short confirmation message for the user

The administrator then provides a human-curated response consisting of:
- a reflective synthesis
- a simplified 14-day action plan

The application is intentionally minimal and non-subscription-based.

## Features

- Responsive, mobile-first UI
- Accessible form layout with progressive disclosure
- EmailJS integration for client + admin notifications
- Clean separation of concerns (HTML / CSS / JS)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages (static deployment)
- Designed for clarity, not engagement loops

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom properties, grid, responsive design)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- EmailJS (client-side email delivery)
- GitHub Pages (static hosting)

---

## Design Philosophy

This project prioritizes:
- simplicity over feature bloat
- human clarity over automation
- bounded effort over endless optimization

The UX is intentionally calm and low-pressure, reflecting real-world constraints rather than idealized productivity systems.

---

## Use Case

Focus Reset is suitable as:
- a micro-service delivery app
- a proof-of-concept for client intake workflows
- a demonstration of user-centered design
- a foundation for future expansion (auth, dashboards, payments, etc.)

## Status

This is a completed production-ready MVP.
The project is stable, deployed, and actively used in real-world scenarios.
